# Overview of the project


# Basic Calculator

A simple command-line calculator program written in Python that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations interactively. This project is perfect for beginners to learn Python programming and understand how to handle user input, implement loops, and manage errors.

## Features

- **Interactive Menu**: 
  - Start the calculator or exit the program with simple menu options.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: 
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`) with error handling for division by zero.
  - Modulus (`%`)
  - Floor Division (`//`)
- **Error Handling**: 
  - Handles invalid inputs (non-numeric entries or unsupported operators).
  - Prevents crashes due to division by zero or other incorrect inputs.
- **Continuous Execution**: 
  - Perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.

## How It Works

1. **Start the Program**:
   - Run the script and press `1` to start or `0` to exit the program.
2. **Perform Calculations**:
   - Enter the first number when prompted.
   - Enter an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `//`).
   - Enter the second number.
   - The program calculates and displays the result.
3. **Loop**:
   - After each calculation, the program returns to the main menu for further operations.
